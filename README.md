In this project I set up a comprehensive Google Test suite for our Calculator class to automate verification of every arithmetic scenario; this is what it does: it defines a CalculatorTest fixture that creates a fresh Calculator instance for each test, then runs a series of EXPECT_EQ assertions covering normal operations (addition and subtraction of positives, negatives, zeros, and large numbers), boundary conditions using INT_MAX and INT_MIN, and overflow/underflow wrap-around cases. Google Test discovers each TEST_F case, invokes optional SetUp()/TearDown() hooks around the test body to ensure isolation, evaluates assertions (recording non-fatal failures when expectations arenâ€™t met), and finally prints a detailed summary listing passed and failed tests along with file names, line numbers, and actual vs. expected values.
